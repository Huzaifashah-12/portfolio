        <p>I'm a passionate,self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack development (Angular & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters to me.</p>

        <p>I began my journey as a web developer in 2025, and since then, I've continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and learning the latest technologies along the way.</p>

        <p>I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to end, from ideation all the way to development.</p>

        <p>When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on twitter, witnessing the journey of early startups or enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share tech-related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.</p>

        <p>Finally, some quick bits about me.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>B.S. in Software Engineering</li>
          <li>Full time freelancer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>One last thing, I'm available for freelance work, so feel free to reach out and say hello! I promise I don't bite ðŸ˜‡</p>
